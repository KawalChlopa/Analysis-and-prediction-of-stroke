Academy project

## Overview
The project involves the collection and analysis of medical data from Kaggle â€“ Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease. Various risk factors for heart attacks, such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, lifestyle habits, and comorbidities, are examined.

Following data collection, a data cleaning process is conducted, followed by detailed statistical analysis to identify key patterns. Based on the findings, a predictive model is developed to assess the probability of cardiovascular diseases.
